## Agrements:

fieldInfo[xPos][yPos] = [nObstacle, nZombies, nHumans, agentIndexes, ... ]
agentInfos[agentIndex] = agent
PlotEnvironment(fieldInfo, nAgents) 


## Todo:

- [ ] report, theory of simple-reflex agents -> Lars
- [x] theory of learning agents -> Esteban
- [ ] Everyone should play with the code when you recieve the "start coding" SMS. This means making some agents

## 20163011 Research Ants (The third time is the charm!)
#### Dorian
- [x] {1} [Ants Theory and suggestions how to programm it p.59-64](http://www.jgorasia.com/Files/Fall08/CompMod/gorasia08compmod.pdf)

#### Esteban
- [x] [Java browser simulation](http://ccl.northwestern.edu/netlogo/models/run.cgi?Ants.790.569) of the ant foraging system 
- [x] [Java browser simulation](https://web.eecs.utk.edu/~mclennan/Classes/420-527-S13/NetLogo/Ant-Foraging.html) a bit more sofisticated than the one above
- [x] {2} [Article: Ant Foraging Revisited](http://cs.gmu.edu/~eclab/papers/panait04ant.pdf) Contains a pseudo-code
      - Method:
        - Pheromones: 
          Two types: one to locate the food, other to locate the nest. 
          These pheromones evaporate, diffuse and can coexist in one spot.
        - Ants
          Two different states: looking for food, looking for the nest
          As they move they follow the trail they need depending on current state, while leaving a trail of the other type of pheromone.
          Depending on the pheromone levels, the ants preferably move to the front positions, if not to the other 5 positions, if not stays quiet.
          
#### To do
- Read the article {1} and {2} see above.
- Lars: make report based on articles, and with the presentation if you have time
- General agreements for programming people:
  - Pheromone1 -> So that the ants find the way home (long lasting)
  - Pheromone2 -> So that the ants find food (transient)
  - Ant -> See above
  - Environment -> Terrain[nestPheromone, foodPheromone, food]
